          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My beautiful girlfriendâ€”happy and blessed birthday to you. May you enjoy not only this day, but all the days that God wants you to cherish. Babi I am greatly thrilled this day since you are already 19 years of age, I can literally say that you are my "manang". I love you my babi. Continue being an amazing girlfriend, a trustworthy friend, an obedient daughter, and a loving sister. You are not just a typical person babiâ€”for the reason that you are the one who brings color to our lives. </p>
         
          <p class="Tmsg">
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Babi, starting on this dayâ€”I pray you to prosper in lifeâ€”and I want you to know that I am always here for you babi, no matter what. We might find, have some arguments, I assure you that you can always count on me. Since the time I had a connection with you, my ideology be like; IF I CAN, I WOULD. It is because, as long as I canâ€”I would never hesitate to do it for you. 
        </p>
        <p class="Tmsg">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times that I am unable to make you feel loved or at times that I am at my senseless daysâ€”may you not give up on me babi. Because, I may feel tired sometimes due to certain circumstanceâ€”I assure you that I will never leave you or get tired of you. my babi as our bond and relationship grows may we not outgrow our better halves. At times that we find each other hard to understand I hope that we will still try to make it up. Frankly speaking, I can't afford to loose you m'lady.
        </p>
        <p class="Tmsg">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babi, you are the first woman who made me feel to be loved this way. You are the first person to make me feel acknowledged and appreciated. I thank God for answering my prayers. To be honest, back thenâ€”I always include you on my prayers especially on Wednesdays, I always mention on our silent prayers a phrases like "Lord, kung ano gid man ang plano mo sa amon ni sister princess ikaw na bahala Lord". I thank God for making way for both of us, at first I did not expect that you will have the same feelings as I do. My babi, I still remember the days that I am holding back my urge to tell you what I feel towards you especially on the days we were together having coffee or ice cream. That is so cute to reminiscence the early days of our friendship.
        </p>
          <p class="Tmsg">
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My budeng, may we achieve more together and cherish every moment of our lives. Let's continue helping each other in times of despair, my babyy I love you so much. Hoping, we can achieve heights of success in the future, our restless days will be worth it as long as we surrender it all to him. May He bless our manifestationsâ€”Babi, let's continue serving him, and seek for his guidance not only for our relationship but also in everything, especially to those hesitant times that we may not know what to decide. 
          </p>
        <p class="Tmsg">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While writing thisâ€”I still smile remembering the old days. The days I did not expect that I will fall in love with my bestfriend. Not only my bestfriend but the first friend to see my poop Haha. Baby SALAMAT. SALAMAT KAAYO SA IMONG EFFORT SA AKON. I HIGHLY APPRECIATE YOU MY LANGGA. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
